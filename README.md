# Um Jogo

This was the final project of my design patterns university class, but it's clearly unfinished.

## Running the game

To see what was done, you have to:

- Make sure that [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) is installed
- Clone this repo and get inside it
- Run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies
- Run `flutter run` to start the game. It might take some time depending on your PC
